# adventofcode-2021

My C#- and Swift-based attempts at cracking some\* of the puzzles over at https://adventofcode.com/2021.

[Last year, I only did so in C#.](https://github.com/chucker/adventofcode-2020)

*) Depends on how soon I get too lazy.

Each day (so far) is implemented in:

* .NET 6.0 / C# 10.0, written in Visual Studio for Mac 2022 Preview. (It should also run fine in Visual Studio for Windows, or Visual Studio Code, as there aren't any major dependencies.)
* Swift 5.5 (I think?), written in Xcode 13.1.
